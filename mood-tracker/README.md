##  Mood Tracker App

 Iâ€™ve built a mood tracker app using Python and Streamlit, allowing users to log and visualize their emotional patterns over time."

### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Create a project directory:**
    ```
    uv init mood-tracker
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```
    cd mood-tracker
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
    - For Windows:
      ```
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

5. **Check the app on localhost:**
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to see if the app is running.
